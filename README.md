# Stacking_Cornell
The repository shows the work done to perform stacking for the different experts available. The MVP of this implementation is that it considers both positive and negative grasps in order to understand whether a grasp would work or fail.

The helper code from GGCNN would would be needed in order to replicate this work. Contact me for further information.
